One advantage when you use these imputation techniques is that you do not change the mean or median of the column. It is important to note that these are not the only means of doing that. There are a lot of other methods that can be employed, which we will take a look at, in later sessions. Sometimes the missing values in the numerical column are simply replaced by a constant, usually 0. It is very case dependent. There are no hard/fixed rules.\n","\n","Generally speaking, it would not be a good idea as you lose all the information from other columns where you do have information available.
