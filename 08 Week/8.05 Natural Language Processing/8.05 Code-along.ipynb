attaching it to a board, before it's attached to the ceiling.\",\n"," \"There is another option out there that comes with it's own board integrated in, which would make the installation just a little

operation.<br /><br />Ergonomically, these are far superior to the Roller Derby skates I returned and I think they are even better than my last 2 pairs of K2 skates simply because once the laces are tight, they are completely out of the way.',\n"," 'The toe box is well padded and a great shape for my average width feet.',\n"," 'The foot strap is effective and comfortable.',\n"," 'The ankle strap

seat post most of the way down, giving lots of room for growth.',\n"," 'We gave him this bike in March and I am not writing this review in August, so this review is with 5-6 months of experience with using the bike.<br /><br />The bike arrived in a relatively small box and assembly was done in 5-10 minutes.',\n"," 'Attached the handlebars and seat post, tighten with a provided allen wrench and

imagine, is really troublesome for a bike light.',\n"," 'Last week I was riding over some bumpy terrain, the light went out and I could no longer see the road in front of me and hit a giant pothole that gave me an instant pinch flat and blew out the sidewall of my tire.',\n"," \"I've had much cheaper lights that, while not as bright, manage to stay on 100% of the time.\",\n"," \"Beyond that, when I'm riding over said bumpy terrain, I can hear the battery rattling around inside the battery compartment which is incredibly annoying.\",\n"," \"Anyway, I'm not entirely sure I'd recommend this light for bicycling because it doesn't stay on consistently when you need it most.\",\n"," 'Troubleshooting:  People have complained about the light turning off during their rides.',\n"," 'I had this problem too.',\n"," 'As far as I can tell it has something to do with the battery getting compressed over timing and literally, physically shrinking.',\n"," 'I stuck a folded up piece of aluminum foil in between the battery and the spring and it worked well.',\n"," 'The other complaint is that it automatically starts going into a &#34;pulse&#34; mode.',\n"," 'This is because the battery is low and needs to be charged.',\n"," \"The charged doesn't last terribly long so I'd recommend charging it every day or other day.worked great, love not having to carry fuel canisters.\",\n"," 'Tested it at home, boiled a cup of water in under 4min.',\n"," \"It did take considerably longer to boil water while backpacking (5500'+ elevation) mostly the problem was the breeze though since in the morning (no

5s (both with slim cases on).',\n"," \"The light function awesome and even on low I was able to see easily at our campsite.<br />I was able to test the water tight seal and it held up perfectly well.<br />The only things that I wish were different is the material it is made from (it is durable hard plastic, but I prefer the rubbery soft plastic like some of their other cases) and that the case doesn't float the best when loaded.<br /><br />Highly recommend this case to anyone, very versatile!This is by far one of the best products I have ever had.\",\n"," 'I would say that I use this beach tent in our yard on a daily basis for afternoon fun in the sun.',\n"," 'Yesterday we had some serious winds and it did bend a bit, but that is because I forgot to tie the cords at the top.',\n"," 'It was a tad difficult to get open in the wind, but with patience and some sly maneuvers I had it up and locked in in just a few more minutes than usual.',\n"," 'It is important to always use the stakes or sandbags to keep the tent from blowing over.',\n"," 'All in all I really like this product, and I love their customer service people just as much.',\n"," 'Great product!This wound up working fairly well for us.',\n"," 'It really does require someone to get inside to assemble it, but we got it put together in about 90 minutes.',\n"," 'At 11 cubic feet, it really provides a lot of extra storage space.',\n"," \"We we not able to get it to line up 100%, so it did not seal 100%, and we wrapped straps around it to ensure it didn't pop open.\",\n"," 'But, it was a life saver on our

out my cleats on my shoes, so I had a spare pair to use with these pedals.',\n"," 'Then I hopped on the bike and rode to get a beer.',\n"," \"It can't get  much easier than that.<br /><br />To answer the concern about the platforms being heavy and hanging upside down, I don't think it's worse than toe-cages on platform pedals.\",\n"," 'With practice, you can easily put your toe on the backside of the platform and flip it up underneath your foot.',\n"," 'Then once you put your foot on top, the teeth grip your shoe well and holds steady.',\n"," 'After a few stops, flipping the platform quickly came back to me like it was before I switched to clipless.We ordered two of these kayaks, but in addition to these I also have 2 other different models of Intex kayaks.',\n"," 'This particular model has two issues.',\n"," 'The rudder is removable which is nice for storing it, but the draw back is it comes off easily in the water regardless of how well it is put on.',\n"," 'When I contacted the company I was told this was not a common problem, but when I tried to order the replacement part I was told they were sold out and waiting on an additional shipment.',\n"," 'This tells me the problem is probably a pretty common problem.',\n"," 'The second issue is the seam around the opening of the kayak where the operator sits.',\n"," 'It is not tacked down so it is constantly rubbing against you and cutting into any area of your body that comes in contact with it.',\n"," 'It can be corrected with a strong glue before inflation, but considering their other models do not have this problem I think it is something that the company could easily correct.',\n"," \"Not impressed with the company's customer service at all.\",\n"," 'Would rate it a 1.These are some tiny glasses.',\n"," \"I mean, I literally couldn't get them on the bridge of my nose, they just floated above it.\",\n"," 'I had to get another friend to try them on just in case my face had grown distorted unbeknownst to

it, when I went to uninstall it by unscrewing the large red knob, the knob kept turning and turning without loosening the hitch connection until eventually the rod that was attached to the knob unscrewed from the far end connection inside the hitch.',\n"," 'I had to rescrew, pray, try again, and it finally came off.',\n"," 'Maybe I screwed it in too tightly in the first place.',\n"," 'I was
