This estrategy is using information of only one column (univariate technique). However, is more likely that the value of the \"INCOME\" will depend on the values of the other columns for the given customer.

This model performs several steps. \n","\n","First, it will determine how similar is every customer with a missing value on the INCOME column against the other customers which **doesn't have a missing value on the INCOME column**. This \"similarity\" between customers will be based on some kind of distance (Euclidean, Manhattan,...etc) involving the values of the other columns of the customers. \n","\n","Second, the model will consider only the K most similar customers to the one for which we want to determine the value of INCOME. Among this subset of customers, the model will compute the mean of the INCOME column. \n","\n","Finally the missing value of the INCOME column for the given customer will be filled with the previous mean. \n","\n","We could do this manually but it will be vary tedious and prone to an error.
